Game - Feed the Dragon

Background:
    Feed the Dragon is a interactive game where the user will need to save thier village by offer food to the hungry dragon. The user can move their player across the board, visiting village structures, in search of food for the dragon. However, if they do not find enough food before the dragon get's angry, the player loses and the village is gone.

    Structures in the village will be randomized in thier location and food supply. Also, the user must alternate between structures in search of food, one visit to a structure will render one food item untill another structure has been visited.

    Each incremental level will incorporate fewer structures, a less patient dragon, as well as other potential challenges awaiting the user.

Functionality & MVPs
    In Feed the Dragon, users will be able to:
            * Start and reset a Game
            * Toggle sound on and off
            * Navigate on the board, move the player around board coordinates to visit fixed structures/elements on the board 
            * Reveal the content of a structure
    In addition, this project will include
        * A Popup style how to instructions element
        * README File
        * Possible Next steps:
            * CSS Animations for
                * Game instantiation: scrolling circle
                * The Dragon’s patience: load bar
            * Character Engagement 
                * When a user finds food, the user icon in the legend will make a positive movement
